# Readable
This is the final project for the React & Redux portion of [Udacity's React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## Dependencies
The back-end for this project is available [here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter). Readable must connect to this back-end to function properly. Instructions for running the back-end are available in that project. As long as both that back-end and this front-end are run locally, they should connect. If you have a different setup, it may be necessary to update the url of the back-end in [src/utils/api.js](src/util/api.js).
* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server.js`

## Installation & Launch Instructions
Install the necessary packages with `npm install` and launch the application with `npm start`. At this point, the app should be available to you at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## create-react-app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
